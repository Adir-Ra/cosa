To drive innovative approaches to standards-based automation, CDISC has initiated the CDISC Open-Source Alliance (COSA), which supports, promotes, and sometimes sponsors open-source software projects that create tools for implementing or developing CDISC standards.

Join us to learn the basics of how you can leverage the first COSA-approved tools to facilitate the implementation of CDISC standards in your systems.

- TFL Designer
- Visual Define-XML Editor
- Odmlib

We will also share how open-source developers can learn to apply for inclusion in the COSA Directory.
