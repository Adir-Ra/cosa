COSA is excited to announce the <a href="https://cosa.cdisc.org/directory/admiral" target="_blank">admiral</a> Hackathon running the full month of February 2023.

<br/>
<br/>

**Hackathon Objective**
<br/>
Participants will get access to a set of SDTM datasets with accompanying specifications and be tasked with transforming these SDTM datasets to analysis datasets using {admiral} and a set of additional R packages from the pharmaverse. This is an excellent opportunity to upskill in R and become part of a vibrant community who develops open-source R packages for clinical reporting purposes. This community will also serve as a great resource to answer any R or {admiral} questions you may have along the way.

<br/>
<br/>
You can join the hackathon by registering <a href="https://cdisc.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_iA7utwGkSpiH1znyNmomAg" target="_blank">here</a>.
(This will also provide you with a weekly check-in webinar link which can be used to review short demos, allow for questions, etc. )
