Join open-source developers from the CDISC community as they showcase their free tools as part of CDISC Open Source Alliance (COSA). Learn how you can leverage these tools to facilitate the implementation of CDISC standards in your systems.  
<br>
**Tplyr** seeks to provide a solid, flexible, and robust foundation upon which new tools may be built and is designed to be a grammar of building clinical summary tables. It allows you to 'layer' your different table components together to create an output that is ready to be rendered into your clinical report.  
<br>
**Define-XML XLS Stylesheets** can be used in the case of electronic submissions to regulatory agencies.  
<br>
**OpenStudyBuilder** is a new approach to working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities and public disclosure of study information.
