Join open-source developers from the CDISC community as they showcase their free tools as part of the CDISC Open Source Alliance (COSA). Learn how these solutions can help you get up to speed on the Dataset-JSON.  
    
<br/>

**Dataset-JSON** is a data exchange standard for tabular datasets that uses the JSON format. It is part of the ODM v2.0 draft standard and based on the Dataset-XML v1.0 specification. Dataset-JSON comprises a number of enhancements to Dataset-XML, including much smaller file sizes and the addition of essential metadata to support data browsers.  
    
<br/>

Each Dataset-JSON file is connected with a Define-XML file that contains the complete metadata for the dataset. Dataset-JSON is designed to meet the requirements of the regulatory submission use case as well as other data exchange scenarios.  
    
<br/>

But wait! That's not all.  We'll conclude the webinar with a sneak peek at the upcoming  <a href="https://cosa.cdisc.org/directory/admiral" target="_blank">Admiral</a> Hackathon.
