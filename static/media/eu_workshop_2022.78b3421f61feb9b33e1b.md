COSA will be hosting a free workshop focusing on the OpenStudyBuilder at the [2022 European Interchange](https://www.cdisc.org/events/interchange/2022-europe-interchange).  
<br><br>
The OpenStudyBuilder is an open-source project for clinical study specification. This tool is a new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities and public disclosure of study information.  
<br>
At this workshop we will briefly present
* Why you should consider to use the OpenStudyBuilder solution
* Why we share OpenStudyBuilder as an open source project
* Why you should consider to contribute to the OpenStudyBuilder solution  
<br>

Then we will split into number of breakout sessions where a facilitator will present a focus area and demonstrate relevant functionalities in the OpenStudyBuilder tool. The group members can try these and then discuss and reflect. The goal for each breakout group is to present a short overview of their reflections and recommendations within their focus area for everyone.  
<BR>
The following breakout groups have been defined:
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for structured protocol content
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for CRF and data collection
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for SDTM Study Design datasets
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to manage concept-based standards, ideate on BC definitions
* Use NeoDash reports for status reporting on study specifications, Ideate on format and meta-checks
* Ideate on OCM and communication for adapting a OpenStudyBuilder solution
* How to start evaluate and use OpenStudyBuilder, deployment options, system operations and integrations
* Demonstrate DDF API adaptor and discuss DDF API alignment
* Ideate on value drivers for pharma companies in using and contributing to OpenStudyBuilder
* Ideate on business opportunities for vendor services for OpenStudyBuilder
    

When you sign up for the workshop you can select three preferred breakout groups.
