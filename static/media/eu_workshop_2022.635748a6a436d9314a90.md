**Register today!**  [2022 Europe Interchange](https://www.cdisc.org/events/interchange/2022-europe-interchange)  
<br>
COSA will be hosting a free workshop at the 2022 European Interchange focusing on the OpenStudyBuilder. It is open to anyone interested and registration for the main conference is not required. 
The OpenStudyBuilder is an open-source project for clinical study specification. This tool is a new approach for working with studies that once fully implemented will drive end-to-end consistency and more efficient processes - all the way from protocol development and CRF design - to creation of datasets, analysis, reporting, submission to health authorities and public disclosure of study information.  
<br>
At this workshop we will briefly present
* Why you should consider to use the OpenStudyBuilder solution
* Why we share OpenStudyBuilder as an open source project
* hy you should consider to contribute to the OpenStudyBuilder solution
  

Then we will split into number of breakout sessions where a facilitator will present a focus area and demonstrate relevant functionalities in the OpenStudyBuilder tool. The group members can try these and then discuss and reflect. The goal for each breakout group is to present a short overview of their reflections and recommendations within their focus area for everyone.  
<BR>
The following breakout groups have been defined:
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for structured protocol content
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for CRF and data collection
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to make study specification for SDTM Study Design datasets
* Use OpenStudyBuilder to manage concept-based standards, ideate on BC definitions
* Use NeoDash reports for status reporting on study specifications, Ideate on format and meta-checks
* Ideate on OCM and communication for adapting a OpenStudyBuilder solution
* How to start evaluate and use OpenStudyBuilder, deployment options, system operations and integrations
* Demonstrate DDF API adaptor and discuss DDF API alignment
* Ideate on value drivers for pharma companies in using and contributing to OpenStudyBuilder
* Ideate on business opportunities for vendor services for OpenStudyBuilder
    

When you sign up for the workshop you can select three preferred breakout groups.
