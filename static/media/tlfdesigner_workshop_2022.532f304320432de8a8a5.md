**About**

Join us for an interactive workshop to understand and define user needs and requirements for the [TFL Designer](https://cosa.cdisc.org/directory/tflDesigner). We will outline a clear problem statement, gather user requirements, and ideate an open-source prototype. We will also develop high-level, proof-of-concept prioritized features as well as share details about how to sign up for future participation.
