**About**

The objective of this hackathon is to create open-source software tools for working with Dataset-JSON. This hackathon does not restrict the types of software tools developed, but will highlight features desired by the community. For example, software tools that convert to and from Dataset-JSON to other widely used formats are needed. Target formats for Dataset-JSON conversion include formats such as:

- SAS v5 XPORT
- SAS datasets
- R data frames
- Python Pandas data frames
- CSV

Other types of software tools could include a Dataset-JSON browser or viewer, software for performing quality checks, tools that work with Define-XML in combination with Dataset-JSON datasets, and a RESTful API for Dataset-JSON.
