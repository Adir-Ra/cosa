                               </a> <strong>What is COSA?</strong></a> 
                                <ol> <a> COSA stands for the CDISC Open Source Alliance.  CDISC saw the need for providing a platform that would enable open-source developers to highlight CDISC standards projects to drive industry innovation.</a></ol>

                               </a> <strong>What open-source projects can be a member of COSA?</strong></a> 
                                <ol><a> Any open-source project that meets the COSA inclusion criteria may be included in the COSA Repsoitory Directory. This includes existing open-source projects as well as new projects that started in COSA.  </a> </ol>

                               </a> <strong>Why is CDISC creating COSA?</strong></a> 
                                <ol> <a>CDISC has increasingly been approached by members of the community requesting the support and promotion of open-source projects that are focused on driving innovation with CDISC standards. For example, after the CDISC 360 Proof-of-Concept project completed there were several projects that wanted to continue their work and sought support from CDISC.</a></ol>

                               </a> <strong>Why would I want to host my eligible project with COSA?</strong></a> 
                                <ol><a>COSA represents a community of open-source developers and users that provide mutual support and guidance on building sustainable open-source projects that use the CDISC standards. CDISC seeks to support and promote COSA projects to aid them in reaching audiences of users and developers. CDISC also plans to offer communications support and host events such as webinars, conference sessions, and hackathons to promote COSA open-source projects. </a> </ol>
                            </li>   
                            <li> 
                               </a> <strong>Why might my project not be accepted by COSA?</strong></a> 
                                <ol><a>After reviewing a project request, the project will be evaluated against the COSA inclusion criteria. The COSA Governance Board reviews the project request and votes based on whether or not they believe the project meets the documented inclusion criteria. Project requests that do not meet the inclusion criteria will be informed that the project has not been accepted and why. If the project resolves the stated issues, they may re-apply to join COSA.</a> </ol>

                        </ul>

                               </a> <strong>I submitted my project to COSA; when will I hear if it's been accepted?</strong></a> 
                                <ol> <a>The COSA board minimally meets once per month, but typically more frequently.  If the request provides enough information to allow the board to evaluate project eligibility, then it evaluated against the inclusion criteia for possible inclusion in the COSA Repository Directory.  If there are questions about the project, the board may contact the requester to obtain additional information before making the final vote</a></ol>
