                                <ol><a> Any open-source project that adheres to the COSA charter and evaluation criteria may request membership in COSA.  This could be open-source projets that are started in COSA, open-source projects that COSA links to, or open-source projeects that are moved into COSA.  </a> </ol>

                               </a> <strong>Why is CDISC creating COSA?</strong></a> 
                                <ol> <a>CDISC has increasingly been approached by members of the community requesting the support and promotion of open-source projects that are focused on driving innovation with CDISC standards.</a></ol>

                               </a> <strong>Why would I want to host my eligible project with COSA?</strong></a> 
                                <ol><a>Hosting your eligible project with COSA, provides you with avenues of communication (GitHub, CDISC Website, Azure, Social Media, Email), events (Interchange, Hackathons/Connectathon, Webinars, etc.) and numerous collaboration opportunities. </a> </ol>

                               </a> <strong>Why might my project not be accepted by COSA?</strong></a> 
                                <ol><a>After scrutinizing the project against COSA charter and evaluation criteria, an open-source project may be denied membership if it cannot be proven to be focused on implementing or developing CDISC standards to drive innovation in the CDISC community.</a> </ol>

                               </a> <strong>I submitted my project to COSA; when will I hear if it's been accepted?</strong></a> 
                                <ol> <a>The COSA board minimally meets once per week.  If the request provides enough information to allow the board to decide if the project is eligible, then it will be compared with the evaluation criteria and voted upon for inclusion.  If there are questions pertaining to the project, the board may reach out to the requester to obtain more information before a final vote is made</a></ol>
